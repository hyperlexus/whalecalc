# Whaling Calculator.
A calculator for how much you have to whale in genshin to get what you want.

Currently nothing exists since this project is new and serves to help me learn web development and github, but eventually the following should be implemented:

- A system to calculate how many wishes you need to get the banner character with 50/50 adjustment, probability and constellations.
- Same thing for the weapon banner.

- A price calculator for how much you need to spend to get it, with first time purchase bonuses and welkin included
- Outputting the best deal for how to save the most money on your whaling adventures

- A small snide remark on the fact you're not f2p lmao
